# üí° Hand Interaction with ARDK to Play Music
Use hand tracking to track the position of a person‚Äôs hand in the frame. Hand tracking performs palm detection and provides information for the 2D position of the hand and the width and height of the hand. ARDK's Hand tracking uses the hand tracking machine learning model from MediaPipe

üí°<b>NOTE:</b> Hand Tracking is currently experimental and is not ready for production builds

This project makes use of ARDK's Hand Tracking to control a sphere for interaction between objects in the environment and makes use of triggers to play music whenever the sphere is passed through a certain cube.
